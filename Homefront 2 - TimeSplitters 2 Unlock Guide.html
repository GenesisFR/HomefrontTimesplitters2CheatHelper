    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Homefront: The Revolution (aka Homefront 2) has a hidden easter egg where you can play the classic game, TimeSplitters 2 (released Oct 2002), by accessing an arcade cabinet located inside the game. The player walks up to the arcade cabinet and presses a button to interact with it, at which point the screen goes black and TimeSplitters 2 loads and starts up. The player can then play 2 story missions from the game: Siberia and Chicago. This was a sort of "demo" of TimeSplitters 2, allowing the player to only play these 2 missions, but not the rest of the game.</p>
    <p>After the game was released, it was revealed that the entirety of the game was included and could be unlocked using secret cheat codes. These codes remained hidden to the public for several years until 4/9/2021 when they were shared publicly on Twitter. Using these codes, the entire TimeSplitters 2 game can be played, including all story missions plus Arcade and Challenge modes.</p>

    <p>This version of TimeSplitters 2 is an unfinished remastered version of the game that was never released officially. This remastered version was canceled part way through development, and now only exists as part of Homefront 2 (unless released sometime in the future). This version of the game as it exists is not 100% finished, and so some bugs may be present. This version runs in higher resolutions (up to 4K) and higher framerates than the original TS2 game ever did back in 2002. It also features some upgrades to assets, including updates gun sounds and unique lighting effects for fire and laser weapons. This is also the first time TimeSplitters has been playable on PC natively using a mouse and keyboard.</p>

    <h2>How To Enter The Codes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Play through Homefront 2 until you reach the Restricted Zone, the final chapter of the storyline. This may take several hours to do.
        <ul>
          <li>PC players can skip playing the game and unlock TS2 by using a special "attributes.xml" file saved to their PC. More info here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/homefront2ts2unlock">tinyurl.com/homefront2ts2unlock</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Locate the arcade cabinet easter egg, walk up to it, and activate it. Once you interact with it for the first time, a new menu option will appear on Homefront 2's main menu under Extras titled "TimeSplitters 2" where you can easily launch TS2 from then on.</li>
      <li>Start TimeSplitters 2. The game's title will appear and you will then see the main menu with "Story" and "Quit".</li>
      <li>Enter one of the codes below from the Codes section. The game is always listening for code presses, so it doesn't matter which screen you're on, and it also doesn't matter if you back out to the Homefront 2 menu during code presses.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can enter multiple codes in a row (you're not limited to just one at a time).</li>
      <li>You do not have to enter the codes fast. The game does not seem to have a time limit on how fast codes must be entered. You can take a few seconds to push each button in a code's sequence.</li>
      <li>The game does not accept code presses while on the TS2 "Loading" screen. When switching from the main menu to the story mode missions screen, there is a loading screen in between. While this loading screen is present, make sure you don't press any buttons until it's done loading.</li>
      <li>Switching between different menus does not interupt a code. The same code can be performed across different menu screens without the code resetting. In other words, you can start entering a code on the TS2 main menu, then go into story mode menu and back and the code will still work. If a code causes you to back out to the Homefront 2 screen, that is okay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You will need to re-enter the cheats every time you restart Homefront: The Revolution.
        <ul>
          <li>PC players can setup macros to enter the codes for you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
		<li>The game can be buggy. It may freeze or crash entirely unexpectedly. Some story levels, like NeoTokyo, will crash the game.</li>
		<li>Some things will appear scrunched-up or off-screen, like the levels menu. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/svTYmrKl.png"> </li>
      <li>Everything in TS2 is unlocked when you enter a code, including all characters. Even the Consultant character, who is not normally available in the base game. <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b1DuAvZl.jpg"></li>
      <li>Split-screen mode was removed.</li>
      <li>Supposedly, it is possible to play TimeSplitters 2 online using Homefront 2's existing multiplayer modes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="EasterEgg">Locating The Easter-Egg</h2>
    <p>The TimeSplitters 2 arcade cabinet is found in the campaign mode of Homefront: The Revolution. Once you activate the arcade cabinet the first time, you can just play TimeSplitters 2 by picking it from Homefront's main menu under Extras.</p>
    <p>Here is a YouTube video by Eurogamer that explains how to find the arcade cabinet: <a href="https://youtu.be/0N8sKvPwEfo">https://youtu.be/0N8sKvPwEfo</a>.</p>
	  <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Play through Homefront 2's campaign until your get to the "Unlikely Allies" mission. This mission is several hours into the game's campaign mode.
        <ul>
          <li>PC players can skip playing the game and unlock TS2 by using a special "attributes.xml" file saved to their PC. More info here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/homefront2ts2unlock">tinyurl.com/homefront2ts2unlock</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jzdEHjrh.jpg"> </li>
      <li>Go to the building pictured below. In this mission, you steal the clothes off a prisoner in the sewer, then once you climb out of the sewer, you're on a street and can hop over a fence. Climb the fence and turn right and walk along the street. There should be a marker on-screen that you can follow that takes you to the Bourse's front door. The area is located in the "Restricted Zone".<br>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pnCje5bh.jpg"></li>
      <li>Once inside, go up the staircase pictured below. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XEEujFzh.jpg"> </li>
      <li>Turn left at the top of the stairs and follow along the wall. When you reach the end, turn left and there be a big open room. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0Brb3gk.jpg"> </li>
      <li>The arcade cabinet is located in the room on the right of its wall. Walk up to it and press the Interact button to use it. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RjSrRxhh.jpg"> </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>PC GameSave</h2>
    <p>PC players can skip playing through Homefront 2 and unlock TimeSplitters 2 by copying a special file to your gamesave folder. This method bypasses the need to play the game and find the arcade cabinet. Once done, a new option appears in Homefront 2's "Extras" menu labeled "TimeSplitters 2". If you have already played Homefront 2, this method should not interfere with your existing gamesave.</p>
	  <p>Note: This method may cause your graphics settings to change, but you can change them back from the game's settings menu.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the file "attributes.xml" from this link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/homefront2ts2unlock">tinyurl.com/homefront2ts2unlock</a>.</li>
      <li>Install Homefront 2 to your PC (if needed) and run it. Load up the game and get to the main menu at least once, then quit out of the game. After you run the game for the first time, it will make a new gamesave folder on your PC.</li>
      <li>Open a Windows file explorer window and navigate to this address:<br>
        <pre style="font-size: 120%;font-weight: bold;margin: 10px 0;background: #EFEFEF;padding: 9px;">%UserProfile%\Saved Games\homefront2\</pre>
        (hint: copy/paste this^ into Explorer's address bar).</li>
      <li>Open the folder "Profiles" within "homefront2". You should see a file called "attributes.xml". Rename it to something else, such as "attributes.xml.bak".</li>
      <li>Copy the "attributes.xml" file provided into your "Profiles" folder.</li>
      <li>Launch Homefront 2, go to the Extras menu, and TimeSplitters 2 should appear as an option in the menu.</li>
    </ol>

		<h3>Reducing Game Size</h3>
		<p>PC players who are only interested in playing TimeSplitters 2 can delete many of Homefront 2's game files to reduce the size of the game while still allowing TimeSplitters 2 to work. Homefront 2 is 46GB, but only 1.78GB of that is taken up by TimeSplittes 2. Once you unlock the TS2 item in the Extras menu (by finding the easter-egg), then you only need to keep enough of the game's files for Homefront's menu to work so that you can click on TimeSplitters 2.</p>
		<p>To trim down your game folder's size to just 5GB, save a copy of "TS2-Ripper.bat" to your PC and double-click on it to run. It will ask you to enter the path to your Homefront folder, then it will remove everything that isn't needed to run TimeSplitters 2. It puts all of the ripped files in a folder called "ripped" that you can then delete.</p>
